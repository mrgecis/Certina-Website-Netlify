Dear business partners and friends,

The CERTINA Group, with headquarters in Munich, Germany, today announces the acquisition of Meta System S.p.A., a global leader in high-performance electronic systems for electric and hybrid vehicles. The transaction was completed through a competitive M&A process as part of the company’s court-supervised restructuring (Concordato Preventivo).

Going forward, Meta System, now operating as Meta Electronics, will join Certina Group’s international portfolio of automotive companies.

Headquartered in Reggio Emilia, Italy, Meta System generates annual revenues of approximately €140 million and employs 600 people. The company is a technology leader in mission-critical e-mobility applications, including on-board chargers (OBC), DC/DC converters, and integrated systems.

“Meta System’s outstanding technological competence in e-mobility solutions represents a cutting-edge technology for the industry,” said Dr. Stefan Brungs, Managing Partner Automotive at Certina Group. “This is not about traditional combustion engine technology, but about the future of sustainable mobility. By combining Meta’s innovation strength with Certina’s operational expertise, we are committed to driving the next generation of clean, high-performance solutions for the global automotive market.”

With more than 250 patents and decades of engineering expertise, Meta System serves leading premium OEMs and operates a global footprint with R&D and manufacturing facilities across Europe and Asia.

The acquisition strengthens Certina Group’s presence in Italy, where it already operates several industrial companies, and underlines the Group’s long-term commitment to the Italian automotive industry and the global automotive value chain.

“Meta System Electronics brings deep engineering know-how, long-standing OEM relationships, and a strong innovation pipeline,” said Giovanni Santamaria, Partner at Certina. “With our operational support and long-term perspective, we are confident that Meta System will return to a sustainable growth path and continue delivering innovative e-mobility solutions. We see significant potential for joint development and expansion.”

Under Certina’s ownership, Meta System will focus on restoring business stability, enhancing operational performance, and continuing to serve its global customer base with high-performance e-mobility solutions.
