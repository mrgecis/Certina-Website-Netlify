• Forensic accounting algorithm developed by CERTINA's Head of the CERTINA Academy, Prof. Dr. Dr. Joachim Häcker
• Detects potential balance sheet manipulation through advanced statistical analysis
• Successfully applied in CERTINA's due diligence for the MOBOTIX AG acquisition

Dear colleagues and partners,

How can investors detect balance sheet manipulation early — before committing capital?

This question has guided Prof. Dr. Dr. Joachim Häcker, Head of the CERTINA Academy, who has developed a forensic accounting algorithm based on advanced data analytics.

The model identifies statistical irregularities in financial statements that may indicate manipulation or accounting inconsistencies. It has already been applied successfully in our recent due diligence processes — for example, during CERTINA's acquisition of Konica Minolta's majority stake in MOBOTIX AG.

By applying this model in every CERTINA due diligence, we can reduce transaction risk and make investment decisions with greater confidence.
A tool like this might have identified irregularities such as those seen in the Wirecard case much earlier.

The algorithm and its methodology were recently published in the October 2025 issue of ZIR (Zeitschrift für Interne Revision).
